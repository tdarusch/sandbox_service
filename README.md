# Sandbox

Effectively just a portfolio app though I'm not sure what else I'll want to add moving forward - hence the name.

## Configuration

This app uses a file-based H2 datastore locally and Heroku Postgres when deployed. Separate configurations are included in the project so everything will work in either environment, albeit with dummy data when running locally.

## Feedback

If you have any feedback, please reach out to me at tdavikman@gmail.com. Thanks!
